# shiritori-san
###A python bot for Discord to play the Shiritori game.

The Shiritori bot was designed based on a game by Harumoro, his bot titled 'shiritori-kun' didn't fit my needs as I wanted a bot that was made in Python in comparison to his NodeJS. To sort this issue I made my own bot and added made it from square one retaining the features from his bot.
